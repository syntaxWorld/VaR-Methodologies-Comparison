# VaR-Methodologies-Comparison

This project involves the use of different Metodologies to calculate the Value at Risk of a given portfolio of stocks (in this case the SP500). The objective is to analyse which methodology best captures the tail risk inherent to the stock market and thus use that approach to estimate the maximum expected loss that a financial institution could face in the middle of financial distress.

4 main methodologies are discussed:

1. Historial Simulation
2. Risk Metrics
3. Garch
4. Filtered Historical Simulation
  
A description of the methodologies are briefly discussed inside the notebook.
